# Shake to Reload Video

This repository contains code samples demonstrating how to reload the video (player) when a shake gesture is detected.

## sample-1.html

This sample uses THEOplayer to reload the video. THEOplayer's Network API is used to create artificial network issues after 15-30 seconds.

The [shake.js](https://github.com/alexgibson/shake.js/) library is used to detect shake gestures.
